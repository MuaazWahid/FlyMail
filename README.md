# Winner - Best Internet Of Things @ BaseHacks III
Today's world is full of complications and information that is easily lost in other information found in other information. With the hassles of letters, taxes, bills, and paychecks all coming in the same place, we decided to make it a bit more organized.

This is why we made Fly Mail, an physical electronic mail box that sorts and stores your mail into piles and the cloud respectively, allowing organization and an effortless life style at the forefront of your day.
Hardware with Arduino, relay from digikey (since we dont have a H bridge), Dragonboard for running vision, and a low res usb camera. Most important of all, a Nike 'project' box.
